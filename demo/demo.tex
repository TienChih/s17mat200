The following cell illustrates repeatedly (nr\_samples times) sampling a discrete distribution and recording the results.
      
 \begin{sageCell}
P = [.4, .3, .2, .1] #Enter a Discrete Probability Distribution
nr_samples = 10000. #Number of times we sample the mean (bar{X}) distribution  


counts = [0] * (len(P))
X = GeneralDiscreteDistribution(P)
for j in range(nr_samples):
    Z=X.get_random_element()
    counts[Z] += 1

    
    
    
bar_chart(counts)

 \end{sageCell}


The following demonstrates repeatedly  (nr\_samples times) sampling the sum of $n$ values from a discrete distribution and recording the results

 \begin{sageCell}
P = [.4, .3, .2, .1] #Enter a Discrete Probability Distribution
n=1  #Number of times distribution P is sampled
nr_samples = 10000. #Number of times we sample the mean (bar{X}) distribution  


counts = [0] * (n*len(P)-n+1)
X = GeneralDiscreteDistribution(P)
for i in range(nr_samples):
    Z=0
    for j in range(n):
        Z+=X.get_random_element()
    counts[Z] += 1

    
    
    
bar_chart(counts)

 \end{sageCell}
