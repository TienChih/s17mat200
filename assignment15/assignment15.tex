\begin{problem}
Suppose that out of 400 surveyed adults, 300 of them support the candidacy of candidate A for elected office.  Can I, with $\alpha=0.025$, claim that at least 70\% of adults will support candidate A?

\begin{enumerate}
\item What sort of hypothesis test are we using?

\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice{$Z$ Test}
\choice{$T$ Test}
\choice[correct]{Proportion Test}
\end{multipleChoice}

\item The $p$-value is: $\answer{0.0145}$

\item Which of the following is true:

\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice[correct]{I can claim, with this $\alpha$, that at least 70\% of adults will support candidate A.}
\choice{I can claim, with this $\alpha$, that less than 70\% of adults will support candidate A.}
\choice{I cannot claim, with this $\alpha$, that at least 70\% of adults will support candidate A.}
