\item Consider the following graph:

\begin{onlineOnly}
$$\graph[xmin=-2,xmax=2,ymin=-0.5,ymax=1, panel]{N=e^{-x^2/2}/(2\pi)^{(0.5)}, P=\int_{z_1}^{z_2} N dx, a=-1, b=1, s=1, m=0, z_1=(a-m)/s, z_2=(b-m)/s, 0<y<N\left\{z_1<x<z_2\right\}}$$
\end{onlineOnly}
(This graph allows one to visualize and compute normally distributed probabilities.  Sliders $a$ and $b$ control the left and right endpoints, whereas $m, s$ denote the mean and standard deviation respectively.  Then $P$ is proportion of the normal curve between $a$ and $b$ with $z$-scores $z_1, z_2$ respectively.  A larger version of this graph may be found here: \url{https://www.desmos.com/calculator/y1pdds9uga}.)


\begin{sageCell}
from scipy.stats import norm

normdist = norm()

mean=120 # Put the mean of the distribution here
std=30  # Put the standard deviation of the distribution here.
P=0.4  # P is the value such that everything to the left of X is P

X=normdist.ppf(P)*std+mean

print('The area to the left of '+`X`); print(' on the normal curve with mean '+`mean`); print(' and standard deviation '+`std`); print(' is  '+`P`)
\end{sageCell}
(The above SageCell allows one to input a probability/area $P$ and it will find a value $X$ so that the probability/are to the \textbf{LEFT} of $X$ is $P$.)




Suppose that Kyle Sumner takes his new boat out into the water to catch yellowfin tuna, whose weights are normally distributed with mean 120 pounds and standard deviation 30 pounds.  

\begin{enumerate}
\item If Kyle catches a yellowfin, what is the probability that he catches a tuna between 120 and 140 pounds? $\begin{prompt}
    P(120\leq X\leq 140)= \answer{0.2475}
  \end{prompt}$ (round to 4 decimal places)
  \item  Find a value $X$ so that the probability that Kyle catches a fish at least $X$ pounds is 60\% $X=\answer{112.3996}$
\end{enumerate}
