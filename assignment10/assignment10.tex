\begin{problem}
Suppose that eight students take a test, each has a 75\% to pass.

\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the probability that 5 students pass.  $\answer{0.1038}$.
\item What is the expected number of students that will pass? $\answer{6}$.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{problem}
Suppose that a football team plays 3 games and has a 60\% chance of winning each game:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Find the probability distribution for $X$, the number of games they win:

$$\begin{array}{c|cccc}
X & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3\\
\hline
P(X) & \answer{0.064} & \answer{0.288} & \answer{0.432} & \answer{0.216}
\end{array}
$$

\item What is the probability they lose at least 2 games?  $\answer{0.352}$


\end{enumerate}
